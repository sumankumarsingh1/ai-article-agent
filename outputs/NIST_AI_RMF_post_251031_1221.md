The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released its AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), a comprehensive guide to help organizations manage risks associated with artificial intelligence. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing organizations to tailor it to their specific needs and risk tolerance. It emphasizes a collaborative approach, encouraging stakeholders to work together to identify, assess, and mitigate risks. The AI RMF is structured around four core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage, which align with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This alignment ensures consistency and familiarity for organizations already using the cybersecurity framework. The framework also highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement, ensuring that risk management remains an ongoing process. Organizations are encouraged to adopt the AI RMF to build trust in AI systems and foster responsible innovation. [/INST]
